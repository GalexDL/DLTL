      <span style="color: brown">Tiering System:</span> For Galex and Rigelians Timeline, I have put a tiering of the importance of story.
        <br>
        Silver Border = Chapters (excludes story marked images for right now)
        <br>
        Bronze Border = Not neccesrally vital, but good world building.
        <br>
        Gold = These Stories are vital to grasping the story or have enough substance to be considered a chapter.

      <span style="color: brown">Spoiler Safe!!!:</span> By default, I have added a spoiler cover image to prevent new comers from being spoiled!
      Hovering (on mobile touching) over a spoiler marked image, will remove the spoiler tag!
      You can permanently toggle it off by pressing the "Spoiler Toggle" button.
